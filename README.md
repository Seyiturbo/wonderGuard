<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project we created a seamless traveller's companion application that a user can use to navigate the world confidently with real-time information from top travel advisory APIs, ensuring a user stay informed and updated about safety and risk levels of any proposed travel destination. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The shades of Blue and white combination makes the UI more appealing to users.
